"""PR-A8 / P0-7 + P4-44 + P4-47: Responses API converter contract.

These tests pin:

- The Codex-emitted ``phase`` field (e.g. ``commentary`` /
  ``final_answer``) survives a forward + reverse trip through the
  Chat-Completions normalizer. Pre-A8 the field was preserved only
  *accidentally* via ``copy.copy(original)``; one refactor away from
  silent data loss.
- Multi-text-part rebuild collapses to a single text part on the way
  back instead of doubling content (the P0-7 bug).
- Unknown item types log a structured warning (P4-47) so operators see
  new Codex item types in flight.
