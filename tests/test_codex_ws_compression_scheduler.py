"""P2 — Codex compression scheduler regression coverage.

The pre-fix code throttled all concurrent Codex WS compression units
through a process-global ``threading.BoundedSemaphore(10)`` and created
a fresh ``ThreadPoolExecutor`` per frame. Under realistic concurrent
load (≥10 sessions) the semaphore saturated, ``elapsed_ms`` was measured
INCLUDING the wait time, and frames hit the parent 30s timeout.

The fix:

* Deletes the module-global ``_CODEX_WS_UNIT_ROUTER_SEMAPHORE``.
* Deletes the per-call inner ``ThreadPoolExecutor``.
* Processes routed units serially inside the frame-level worker thread
  (``self._compression_executor`` already provides frame-level parallelism
  via 32 workers sized ``min(32, cpu*4)``).
* Adds a ``PERF`` log emission from ``handle_openai_responses_ws`` so
  Codex traffic is no longer invisible to ``headroom perf``.

These tests verify that future contributors cannot silently re-introduce
either bottleneck.
