//! Live-zone block dispatcher — Phase B.
//!
//! # The mental model
//!
//! After Phase B PR-B1 retired the message-dropping machinery, all
//! compression happens *within* messages, never *between* them. The
//! live-zone dispatcher walks the request body and identifies the
//! *live zone*: the blocks the model will emit a response *against*,
//! which are the only ones whose bytes can mutate without busting the
//! provider's prompt cache.
//!
//! # Provider scope
//!
//! Phase B ships ONE dispatcher entry point —
//! [`compress_anthropic_live_zone`] — that handles the Anthropic
//! Messages API shape (`/v1/messages`). Other providers (OpenAI
//! Chat Completions, OpenAI Responses, Google Gemini, Bedrock with
//! native payloads, …) need their own dispatchers because their
//! request shapes diverge in load-bearing ways:
//!
//! - OpenAI Chat Completions puts tool results in their own
//!   `role: "tool"` messages, not nested in user messages.
//! - OpenAI Responses uses `input` (not `messages`) with item types
//!   like `function_call_output` and `reasoning`.
//! - Gemini uses `contents`/`parts`/`function_response`.
//!
//! Phase C (`REALIGNMENT/05-phase-C-rust-proxy.md`) introduces
//! `compress_openai_chat_live_zone`, `compress_openai_responses_live_zone`,
//! and friends. They share this module's provider-agnostic types
//! ([`LiveZoneOutcome`], [`BlockAction`], [`CompressionManifest`])
//! and the per-content-type compressor backend, but each owns its
//! own walker.
//!
//! For Anthropic `/v1/messages`, the live zone is bounded by:
//!
//! - **Floor:** `frozen_message_count` (computed by
//!   [`crate::compute_frozen_count`] from explicit `cache_control`
//!   markers; passed in here). Indices below the floor are in the
//!   prompt cache and MUST be byte-identical.
//! - **Ceiling:** the latest user message. The latest assistant
//!   message (if any) is part of the cache hot zone too — it's what
//!   the next response continues from. We never touch it.
//! - **Inside the latest user message:** every block is a candidate.
//!   The most common compressible block type is `tool_result`
//!   (because tool outputs dominate token budgets); `text` blocks
//!   are also eligible (e.g. user pastes a long log).
//!
//! # Phase B build-up
//!
//! - **PR-B2** shipped the dispatcher *skeleton*: identify live-zone
//!   blocks, route to no-op compressors, always return `NoChange`.
//! - **PR-B3** (this PR) wires per-content-type compressors:
//!   `JsonArray` → SmartCrusher; `BuildOutput` → LogCompressor;
//!   `SearchResults` → SearchCompressor; `GitDiff` → DiffCompressor;
//!   `SourceCode` / `PlainText` / `Html` → no-op (B4 + a Rust
//!   code-compressor port follow-up).
//! - **PR-B4** adds the tokenizer-validation gate (per-block
//!   `compressed.tokens >= original.tokens` → fall back) and the
//!   per-content-type byte threshold below which compression is
//!   skipped.
//! - **PR-B7** wires CCR retrieval-marker injection.
//!
//! # Cache safety invariant
//!
//! Bytes outside the live zone are NEVER touched. PR-B3 writes new
//! bodies via **byte-range surgery**: we locate each rewritten block
//! by pointer arithmetic on `serde_json::value::RawValue` borrowed
//! slices (which retain their offset into the original buffer), then
//! splice the replacement into the output. Concretely:
//!
//! ```text
//!     out = body[..block_start] || replacement || body[block_end..]
//! ```
//!
//! The bytes outside the rewritten ranges are *literally copied*
//! from the input, never re-serialized. This is how we guarantee
//! the SHA-256 of the prefix and suffix are byte-identical to the
//! input — Phase A's fixtures and B3's `byte_fidelity_outside_compressed_block`
//! test pin this in CI.
//!
//! Why byte-range surgery and not "deserialize → mutate → serialize"?
//! Re-serializing a JSON `Value` does not preserve original
//! whitespace, key order subtleties, or numeric formatting that the
//! provider may have already cached against. Byte-faithful copy of
//! everything we don't touch is the only way to guarantee
//! cache stability — see `project_compression_realignment_2026_05`.
//!
//! # AuthMode
//!
//! The `AuthMode` parameter is taken in B3 but unused — Phase F
//! PR-F2 wires the gate (PAYG/OAuth/Subscription each demand
//! different policies; see project memory
//! `project_auth_mode_compression_nuances.md`). Keeping the
//! parameter in the signature now means later PRs are pure
//! implementation swaps, not signature redesigns.
