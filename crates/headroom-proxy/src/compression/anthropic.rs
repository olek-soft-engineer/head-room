//! Anthropic `/v1/messages` request compression — Phase A passthrough stub.
//!
//! # Phase A lockdown (PR-A1)
//!
//! Per `REALIGNMENT/03-phase-A-lockdown.md`, this function is now a
//! byte-faithful passthrough. The previous implementation invoked
//! `IntelligentContextManager` with a hardcoded `frozen_message_count: 0`,
//! which destroyed Anthropic prompt-cache hit rate by dropping messages
//! out of the cache hot zone. That bug cluster (P0-3, P0-4, P0-5,
//! P1-13) is eliminated by *not running the compressor at all* until
//! Phase B builds the live-zone-only replacement.
//!
//! The function signature is preserved so the call site in `proxy.rs`
//! still compiles unchanged. Phase B PR-B2 fills this back in with the
//! live-zone block dispatcher (compress only the latest user message,
//! latest tool/function/shell/patch outputs — never historical turns).
//!
//! # What this returns
//!
//! Always `Outcome::NoCompression`. The caller (`proxy.rs`) reacts to
//! that by forwarding the original buffered bytes verbatim.
//!
//! # What it does NOT do
//!
//! - Does NOT parse the JSON body. The whole point of Phase A is byte
//!   faithfulness; parsing + re-serialization could perturb whitespace,
//!   numeric precision, key ordering, and Unicode escaping. Even
//!   though we wouldn't re-emit the parsed value here, parsing is
//!   wasted work and would invite future "while we're here" mutations.
//! - Does NOT touch headers, body, or any other request state.
//! - Does NOT depend on `IntelligentContextManager` (the type is gone
//!   from this module's call graph; `mod.rs` no longer imports `icm`).
//!
//! # Logging
//!
//! Emits exactly one structured `tracing::info!` per call, with the
//! decision (`"passthrough"`), the reason (`"phase_a_lockdown"`), the
//! configured `compression_mode`, and the body byte count. The
//! `request_id` and HTTP method/path come from the caller's
//! existing log context (added in `proxy.rs`).

///   emits a `tracing::warn!` for `LiveZone` (since the live-zone
///   dispatcher isn't built yet) — see `proxy.rs`.
/// - `request_id`: the per-request id used for log correlation. The
///   caller already produced it (`ensure_request_id`); we accept it
///   as a borrowed `&str` so this function doesn't need its own
///   uuid dep.
///
/// # Returns
