//! Compression interceptor for LLM-shaped requests.
//!
//! # Phase A lockdown (PR-A1)
//!
//! Per `REALIGNMENT/03-phase-A-lockdown.md`, the
//! `IntelligentContextManager`-driven path that previously ran on
//! every `/v1/messages` request is gone. Today this module is a
//! tracking shell: it owns the path-matcher (`is_compressible_path`)
//! and the Anthropic decision stub (`compress_anthropic_request`)
//! that always returns `Outcome::NoCompression`.
//!
//! Phase B PR-B2 reintroduces real compression, but with two
//! invariants the deleted code violated:
//!
//! 1. The cache hot zone (system, tools, historical messages,
//!    reasoning items, thinking signatures, redacted_thinking,
//!    compaction items) is never modified.
//! 2. Compression is append-only: only the live zone is rewritten.
//!
//! # Provider matrix (current + planned)
//!
//! | Provider     | Path                  | Status |
//! |--------------|-----------------------|--------|
//! | Anthropic    | `POST /v1/messages`   | passthrough (PR-A1) → live-zone (PR-B2) |
//! | OpenAI       | `POST /v1/chat/completions` | follow-up |
//! | Google       | `POST /v1beta/...`    | follow-up |
//! | Bedrock      | varied                | follow-up |
//!
//! # Failure-mode contract
//!
//! Compression must NEVER break a request. Even when Phase B brings
//! a real dispatcher back, every error path falls through to the
//! original body being forwarded unchanged.
